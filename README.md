# ðŸ“± Social Media Post Text Classification using Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a Hugging Face Transformer model for text classification of social media posts. The goal is to classify posts into predefined categories such as "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", or domain-specific labels (e.g., "Promotion", "News", "Spam").

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`) using Hugging Face Transformers
- Text classification for short-form social media content (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
- Training with custom or public datasets
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Exporting the model for inference
